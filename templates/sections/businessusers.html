            <p>Although privileged accounts should be a key focus point of any IT organization's security strategy, it is important not to forget the role that non-privileged users play in the attack chain. In many cases attackers will gain a foothold into the network by taking control of a user account, and using it to perform reconnaissance within the network to find targets worth expending energy on breaking into. Non-privileged accounts could potentially help an attacker to steal even more powerful credentials - if such accounts have access to servers. </p>
            <p>In general it is bad practice to allow personal or shared non-privileged users to log into servers, because there they have the rights to examine applications and services that are running, and potentially gain useful information that could be exploited later on. Understanding which users have access to these servers, and removing their access if appropriate, should form part of a privileged access management project.</p>

                        <p>As most Windows Servers are joined to an Active Directory domain, and user permissions are managed using AD groups rather than directly on their account, it is not uncommon to see these groups used to control access via RDP and other remote access protocols. If these groups are used to allow remote access to servers, care must be taken that least-privilege principles are still applied – indiscriminately allowing group access might result in inadvertently giving access to an unauthorized user. When such access is legitimate, care should be taken to use the correct groups – relying on blanket groups such as ‘Domain Users’ can easily lead to over-provisioning of access rights.</p>
